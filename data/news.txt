			"There has been no confirmation from Navy Design Bureau on a new capital vessel type being build right now. Our sources claim, that large funding budget was reserved some time ago for top secret project of a grand scale. Yet the details are unknown. Admiral Connors from Navy Design Bureau has refused to comment on the subject."
			"The Admiralty has claimed that no public funding is being used for any undisclosed capital vessel construction. All Navy projects have already been approved and are reported in the annual Navy budget report in section 3a. Any claims on new type capital vessels are unfounded and dubious and will have be denied by Navy officials."

			"On recent news conference, Admiralty and Navy Design Bureau have officially denied, that experimental capital vessel was damaged and stolen by unidentified party.

			"During Senate hearing on Navy capital vessels missing, Admiral Connors from Design Bureau has confirmed that no serving capital vessel has been harmed, stolen or misused. Any recent reports claiming to the contrary were commented by the admiral as fake news."

			`	The spaceport is definitely too cheerful, as a large group of workers listens to one tipsy parton. "You not gonna believe it. Red Diggers not only sat in Navy database for more than a year undetected, but they also managed to get away with a heist on a new huge capital ship. They lured escort away and whisked it away from testing grounds. They should have been here some time ago. If not, They're probably redecorating it as an asteroid, and a surely big one."`
			`	The guy in a spaceport bar is definitely gloating to loud. "Friend of mine hacked their database and the blueys never noticed that he ciphered them the whole designs catalogue. Everything, old designs, lif designs, even the latest capital ships. And, he was a smart one, he coded them their backups... all of them. Now, the Reds are going to have the only copy of the new Navy not-so-rusteee big-ass bucket."`

			"A famous Admiral Connors from Navy Design Bureau has finally decided to retire from active duty. Admiral Yen has commented that the Navy looses valuable officer that ha never failed in the line of duty and improved Republic security immensely with his brilliant design ideas and exemplary projects on Navy info-security. "I'm sad to see such a great officer decided to pass the torch. Without him, We'll feel a bit less safe."
			"Navy Command has issued a warning, that the old, damaged and unfit for flight vessel that was scuttled, had recently been repurposed by unidentified individuals as a makeshift flying dock. All stations and planets are advised to proceed with caution during interactions with this risky derelict. The ship was decommissioned and was never meant for a reuse. A new owner of the wreck is strongly advised to return it to the nearest Navy shipyard for proper disassembly."
			"The Senate has issued a request to the Navy Command for a report on ongoing projects that have no public funding. The budget and defence commissions are interested if the Navy is spending outside preplanned budgetary constraints. The Navy has agreed, that such report will be delivered without any delay, but given personnel and funding cuts, it might require some additional time as that subject requires detailed inquiries into all units project. The necessary requests for report have been already issued to respective field commands."

			`	The spaceport is quiet and hardly attended. The local bars are yet somewhat full. In one, a guy comments loudly on recent events. You know, how it is. Once You ride, once you're ridden. Red Diggers could have it all. Yet, as soon as the stole some big ass flying dock from Navy, some smart-ass in capital razed them to the bones and took it away. It could have been such a sweet base by now." You walk away smiling and knowing fully well who's the new owner of a shiny flying chop-shop is.`
